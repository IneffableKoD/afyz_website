<p>The current exceptional circumstances induced worldwide by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 puts a hard test on society and the technology we have at hand. Data-driven insights can help a great deal in finding solutions to the many problems that arise from these circumstances (I try to avoid calling it a crisis).</p>

<p>I participated in a hackathon called #CodevsCOVID19 and wanted to train myself in using open-source mapping technology. But my journey led me to realize that there is almost no data to be mapped. Astonishingly, there is no map that displays the testing facilities for suspected COVID-19. Not only would the mapping of such data help those that want to get tested, but more importantly, it would help authorities and health officials plan their testing facilities.</p>

<p>Maybe I am late to the party, but I still want to try to create this map. There are various reasons for that:</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information for consumers;</li> 
        <li>Information for officials, crisis response teams, health professionals, and everyone else that has to plan such facilities and maintain them. Further down the line, I want to address broader disaster/crisis response mapping maybe also &ndash; but that are dreams of the future for now.</li>

    </ul>    
</p>
<p>My personal interest is also twofold: I want to brush up my rusty coding game, and I want to gain a more in-depth understanding of mapping (which is relevant for the company I co-founded and lead).</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about the project and maybe even want to contribute to it, I suggest you have a look at the repository. The <a href="https://github.com/IneffableKoD/cov19testmap/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README.md</a> file has some more background on the history of the project, and the <a href="https://github.com/IneffableKoD/cov19testmap/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> file has information on how you can contribute to the project.</p>

<p>The most help you can be is by providing data to be mapped. I would greatly appreciate it if you point me to data (in whatever format, may it only be a website). If you don't have data yourself, help me by sharing the request on social media. You can also share a simple Google Form I set up for entering data: (link Google).</p>

<p>Last but not least, I want to say thank you to everyone that has been a help or has supplied code/data for this project!</p>

<p>Stay healthy, stay safe, and #StayHomeSaveLifes!</p>
